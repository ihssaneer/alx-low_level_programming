This directory builds upon the foundational concepts of C programming and introduces more advanced functions and deeper understanding of nested loops. The materials provided here will help you enhance your problem-solving and programming skills.

## Contents
The directory includes the following files and subdirectories:

- [0-isupper.c](0-isupper.c): A C function that checks if a character is an uppercase letter.
- [1-isdigit.c](1-isdigit.c): A C function that checks if a character is a digit.
- [2-mul.c](2-mul.c): A C function that multiplies two integers.
- [3-print_numbers.c](3-print_numbers.c): A C function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.
- [4-print_most_numbers.c](4-print_most_numbers.c): A C function that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.
- [5-more_numbers.c](5-more_numbers.c): A C function that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14.
- [6-print_line.c](6-print_line.c): A C function that prints a straight line of a specified length.
- [7-print_diagonal.c](7-print_diagonal.c): A C function that prints a diagonal line of a specified length.
- [8-print_square.c](8-print_square.c): A C function that prints a square of a specified size.
- [9-fizz_buzz.c](9-fizz_buzz.c): A C function that prints the "Fizz-Buzz" sequence.
